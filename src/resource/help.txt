Main screen of the application contains pack of timers. These timers can display time spent on different tasks (up to 10 tasks at one time). To set quantity of timers, use Main menu - Options.
To open or add new task, press "Task..." button in any timer frame. Task selection window shall appear. To add new task, just enter new task's name in corresponding field in the top of the window and press "Add task". Or select task from list below and press "Open".
After that, task will appear in timer frame on main screen. Here one can start/stop timer. Any time start/stop button is pressed, new "Timestamp" is created. To view all timestamps, press "View timestamps" button. "Timestamp" and "Time spent since" columns display data in time spent on the task terms, not real time. And "date and time" column displays local time when timestamp created. It's possible also to create your own timestamps using "Add timestamp" button and delete any timestamp from the list.
Every task has its properties - name, description, tags. All of them, except name (it's unique parameter and cannot be changed) can be edited in Properties window (opened by pressing eponymous button in timer frame or in task selection window). Here one can set description and tags. New tags also can be created here, and after that, assigned to any task (by setting checkboxes).
In task selection window filter can be applied. Tasks can be filtered by date ot tag, or both. When filter is enabled, it's button is coloured blue.
Also here is export button. Tasks list can be exported to .csv reports. Csv contains exactly same tasks that are in the list, e.g. if some filter is enabled, exported tasks also will be filtered. Exported data can be date-based or task-based. That means different grouping of tasks: by date (which tasks were spent time on for each date) or by task (what dates had been every task worked on).
